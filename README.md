 Analyzing the different concepts between Flask&Django

This was initially created so that I could understand about web infastructues and how different Django and flask were from each other.
The purpose of this was to create a base framework in which I can create my own future frameworks without any tutorials. This was used to help me understand the different things that Django currently offers in terms of rendering UI and how it actually stores the backend information from the user. 
I also used this program to help understand the different concepts of DevOps and how to deploy within a VirtualEnv and hopefully incorporate Docker in the future.
